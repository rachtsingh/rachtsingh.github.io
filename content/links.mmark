Here are some useful links I've found:

### LaTeX
- A `tikz-cd` graphical editor that I wish I'd during 55... - http://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/
- For high power Bayesian diagrams, I like [tikz-bayesnet](https://github.com/jluttine/tikz-bayesnet), but honestly it's often not worth the trouble vs. using `tikz-cd` and adding a circle macro.
- ShareLaTeX is quite useful for collaborating, and [open source](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex). One day when I have time I'll make a PR...

### Vim
- My [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) are here: http://github.com/rachtsingh/dotfiles . They're really out of date, but when my life calms down a bit I'll go through and clean it up.
- I *really* like Aleks Kamko's [tag](https://github.com/aykamko/tag) for adding a quick goto after using ag or ripgrep.
- I use [cVim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh?hl=en) to move around on Chrome quickly.
