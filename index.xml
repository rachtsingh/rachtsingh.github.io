      <description>Here are some useful links I&#39;ve found:
LaTeX  A tikz-cd graphical editor that I wish I&#39;d during 55... - http://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/ For high power Bayesian diagrams, I like tikz-bayesnet, but honestly it&#39;s often not worth the trouble vs. using tikz-cd and adding a circle macro. ShareLaTeX is quite useful for collaborating, and open source. One day when I have time I&#39;ll make a PR...  Vim  My dotfiles are here: http://github.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m starting this blog to share research ideas that I have, and some solutions to problems I find along the way. I&#39;ve been helped immensely by other people&#39;s blogs in the past, and want to do the same. Also it&#39;ll give me a chance to communicate the way I approach problems, and hopefully people will give me alternative perspectives either by email (rachitsingh@college.harvard.edu) or in the comments, once I figure out how that works.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Rachit Singh, and I&amp;rsquo;m a senior at Harvard, doing research in variational inference, Indian Buffet processes, and language models. I work with Alexander Rush, Finale Doshi-Velez, and I&amp;rsquo;m part of the Harvard NLP research group. I frequently work with Jeffrey Ling.
I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in probabilistic programs, especially those like Edward, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to help build Pyro to be just as powerful, once I understand how it works. I like to write very fast code (I have a bit of CUDA + RTOS microcontroller work under my belt) in a variety of languages.</description>
