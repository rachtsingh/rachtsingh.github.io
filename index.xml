      <description>td { padding: 5px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.25rem; } th { text-align: center; padding: 0px 5px; } th.left_column { text-align: right; } figure { margin: 0px 20px; max-width: 50rem; } img[src*=&#34;#smaller&#34;] { width: 50%; margin: auto; }  tldr: The ubiquitous isotropic Gaussian prior for generative models doesn&#39;t make sense / doesn&#39;t work, which motivates work on priors.
At NIPS, Dawen Liang mentioned Hoffman &amp;amp; Johnson&#39;s ELBO surgery paper offhand while talking about tuning KL divergences, and it&#39;s very interesting, so I thought I&#39;d go over it.</description>

      <description>Here are some useful links I&amp;rsquo;ve found:
LaTeX  A tikz-cd graphical editor that I wish I&amp;rsquo;d during 55&amp;hellip; - http://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/ For high power Bayesian diagrams, I like tikz-bayesnet, but honestly it&amp;rsquo;s often not worth the trouble vs. using tikz-cd and adding a circle macro. ShareLaTeX is quite useful for collaborating, and open source. One day when I have time I&amp;rsquo;ll make a PR&amp;hellip;  Vim  My dotfiles are here: http://github.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m starting this blog to share research ideas that I have, and some solutions to problems I find along the way. I&#39;ve been helped immensely by other people&#39;s blogs in the past, and want to do the same. Also it&#39;ll give me a chance to communicate the way I approach problems, and hopefully people will give me alternative perspectives either by email (rachitsingh@college.harvard.edu) or in the comments, once I figure out how that works.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Rachit Singh, and I&amp;rsquo;m a senior at Harvard, doing research in variational inference, Indian Buffet processes, and language models. I work with Alexander Rush, Finale Doshi-Velez, and I&amp;rsquo;m part of the Harvard NLP research group. I frequently work with Jeffrey Ling.
I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in probabilistic programs, especially those like Edward, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to help build Pyro to be just as powerful, once I understand how it works. I like to write very fast code (I have a bit of CUDA + RTOS microcontroller work under my belt) in a variety of languages.</description>
